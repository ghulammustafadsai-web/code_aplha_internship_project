## 📌 Project Overview
Developed during my **CodeAlpha Internship**, this project analyzes the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on India's labor market. Using Python-based data science workflows, it identifies critical shifts in unemployment rates across states, regions, and sectors.

## 📊 Key Insights
* **The Pandemic Surge**: The national average unemployment rate rose from **9.5%** (Pre-COVID) to **17.8%** during the pandemic—an increase of **~86.9%**.
* **Peak Crisis**: Unemployment reached its absolute peak in **April 2020**, hitting **24%**.
* **Regional Extremes**: **Haryana** and **Tripura** recorded the highest unemployment rates overall.
* **State Resilience**: **West Bengal** was identified as the state least impacted by COVID-related unemployment.
* **Sector Divergence**: While rural areas saw a **3% increase** in unemployment, urban areas in this dataset recorded a **3% decrease** during the same period.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
* **Strengthen Rural Safety Nets**: Expand programs like MGNREGA to buffer the 3% rise in rural joblessness.
* **Targeted Aid**: Focus structural reforms on high-unemployment zones like Haryana and Tripura.
* **Digital Resilience**: Invest in digital infrastructure to support the remote-work trends observed in urban areas.
* **Adopt "Best Practices"**: Study the "West Bengal Model" to identify policies that maintained employment stability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Analysis**: Data cleaning, time-series extraction, and comparative EDA.
